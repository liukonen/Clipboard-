# Clipboard++

## reason: I wanted an application that I could use that kept an in memory cache of mutiple clipboard items. That way if I accidently copied over some data I was working on, I could go back to the original version

### future enhancements
* Be able to save cliped items
* store / retrieve clip items on drive for reboots
* In memory compression on text items
* in memory cryptography on items
* options form, to configure compression, max number of items, and cryptography
* pre defined hotkeys for cached items
* Lock perticular cache items to list
* prevent duplicate items from being in memory
* better about me screen
* winform with better display of cache items (optional)
* have a better icon then "default"

# Technology used
* low level pointers
* dll import
* sha1 hashing
* binary serialization
* winform development
* notification icon development
